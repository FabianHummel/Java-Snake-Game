## :coffee: Java Snake Game:

A totally overcomplicated implementation of the famous snake game written in Java Swing. It features large modularity to extend the game in any way you want.

## :warning: Side Notes:

The game is still in a very early state and contains a huge amount of bugs. Also to be able to respawn, you need to restart the game.
